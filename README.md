Game developed with C++. There are 3 modes in the game;\
1-Human Player vs. Human Player\
2-Human Player vs. Computer Player\
3-Computer Player vs. Computer Player\

For Computer player, I used Minimax Game Algorithm as an AI. I used 2 different heuristic algorithm in order to provide different results for computer vs. computer mode.
